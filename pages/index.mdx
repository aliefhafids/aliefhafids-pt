## Maulana Alief Hafids

Hi, I'm an active college student in Business Information Systems, State Polytechnic of Malang. I participated in the Bootcamp Program at the Merdeka Campus as a Full Stack Web Developer. I'm currently learning about frontend-backend, react, and design

I have enthusiasm in programming, I keep learning new things and practicing the basic skills that I already have. My curiosity drives me to keep learning about new things, and that will make me find new experiences.
