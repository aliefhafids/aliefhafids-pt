# introduction

One of my final assignments for one of my college assignments was to make the user interface of an application. And in this final project I made the UI of a mobile application, the design starts from the name of the application, the features available, and how the reaction is displayed by the application when the user interacts.

>User Interface is a visual element that is useful for connecting users with technology systems. The system in question is generally related to applications, websites, video games, software and hardware. UI is concerned with how buttons are aligned on the system, including scrollbars, logos, and icons.

 The design of the mobile application that I made took the theme of e-commerce for a fashion store in Malang, namely a distortion store. This shop provides clothes for local and foreign bands. and to make it easier to buy goods at distortion stores, this time I made a mobile application design and an application prototype when it was run.
