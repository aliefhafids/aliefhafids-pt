# Arkatama Log

## Week 1

This week's lesson starts with using the REST API used in Laravel. With a little review at the previous meeting, an explanation of the REST API starts from the meaning of the rest api itself. REST APIs enable communication between clients and servers by using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources represented in a format which is often JSON or XML. Checking API url in Laravel can use postman to check it, add url to api.php file in our project, and we access this url using postman depending on the method used in this url. The second meeting this week is how we deploy the web application that we have created which can be accessed via a live server, participants are asked to host the web application that we have created on a web hosting page, either free or paid.

## Week 2

## Week 4

Graduation at PT Arkatama Multi Solusindo, the last moment of participating in independent learning activities at PT Arkatama. Taught how to become a full stack web developer, become a competent and professional web developer at the front end and back end. And in the end the results of these activities participants can produce a web application product from the implementation of the learning that has been given. I am very grateful to PT Arkatama Multi Solusindo because I can participate and be part of the independent learning participants.âœ¨ðŸŽ‰
