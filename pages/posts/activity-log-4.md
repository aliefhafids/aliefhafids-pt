# Arkatama Log

## Week 1

This week's lesson starts with using the REST API used in Laravel. With a little review at the previous meeting, an explanation of the REST API starts from the meaning of the rest api itself. REST APIs enable communication between clients and servers by using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources represented in a format which is often JSON or XML. Checking API url in Laravel can use postman to check it, add url to api.php file in our project, and we access this url using postman depending on the method used in this url. The second meeting this week is how we deploy the web application that we have created which can be accessed via a live server, participants are asked to host the web application that we have created on a web hosting page, either free or paid.

## Week 2

Arkatama independent study participants are entitled to take part in the BNSP (Badan Nasional Sertifikasi Profesi) program to obtain a certificate, participants are given certain case studies and must create applications using both native PHP and Laravel. This week Arkatama is providing assistance with activities related to the preparation for the BNSP exam which will be held on June 22. Some registration requirements must be applied to each participant's website. The registration form for registration on the LSP website and loading of each participant's website portfolio must be done this week. some students were very enthusiastic about taking this certification test and some other students had concerns about passing or not if they took part in this BNSP program.
