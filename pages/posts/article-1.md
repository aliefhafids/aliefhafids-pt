# Be safe with the Komplek App Scanner

## Introduction

Advances in technology make it easier for anyone to carry out their activities, for example in making payment activities. Now payments can be made using the Qr code, all we have to do is scan the qr and the system will automatically process the payment. In semester 4  there was a mobile programming course using Flutter, the material provided started from how to layout mobile applications, and how to use API's in mobile applications. In order to pass this course, these students are required to make a car project application, by linking the ease of activity in payment using a QRcode, I decided to make an application used for guarding house.

So the concept of this application is that each security mobile phone will be installed with an application which will later be used to scan the QR code for each komplek. This application will later be useful for recording security working hours because from the QR code realtime data will be input into the database, and later the head of security can monitor the performance of the security.
