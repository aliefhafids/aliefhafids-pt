# Arkatama Log

## Week 1

After the Eid al-Fitr national holiday, learning can be carried out again on May 5, and for the results this week the independent study participants learn advanced PHP, each study carried out by students is required to carry out a pre test and post test to measure the participants' self learning understanding and recall previously presented material. The advanced php material provided starts from the use of functions, branching, and looping. The enthusiasm of the independent study participants welcomed the zoom meeting again after being delayed for 2 weeks, and many independent study participants were still reviewing the material provided during the holidays.

## Week 2

The material explained in the PHP request form begins with what is meant by the request method/mechanism for sending data from one page to another via a link in a web browser. methods that can be used like GET | data sending method with data sent in the form of a URL in the form of a series of name/variable and value/value pairs beginning with a question mark symbol (?) and separated by an “AND” symbol or ampersand (&). And also given material about several functions that can be used in sessions, such as session_start(), session_unset(), session_destroy(). and at zoom it is also practiced regarding the use of sessions and cookies in the browser, the explanation given by the trainer is quite clear.

## Week 3

This week the material provided will cover the concept of object oriented programming (OOP), **what is OOP?** A programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and the interactions between them. In PHP, OOP can be implemented using classes and objects. and explain some important concepts like class, object, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. And an explanation regarding the application of the concept of inheritance / inheritance, abstraction. and for laravel to explain material regarding laravel features which have strong and sophisticated features such as routing, templates, database processing, authentication, and security that have been developed.

## Week 4

Explanation of the material begins to enter the PHP framework using Laravel, this material is a continuation of all the basic principles of programming that have been studied Laravel is a web application framework based on the popular PHP programming language and is widely used to build dynamic and efficient web applications. Laravel has powerful and advanced features like routing, templates, database processing, authentication and security. Laravel uses the concept of an MVC (Model, View, Controller) model to process data, views to present data, and controllers to write logic that connects models and views. The task given to the Laravel material is quite complicated, namely making a CRUD that is implemented in the Laravel framework.

## Week 5

**Authentication, middleware, response? What is that?** Maybe that's what the participants in this week's lesson thought. Some of the features provided in laravel to develop websites, maybe that's the basis of this lesson. The three features above have their respective duties and roles, ranging from authentication used for user verification, middleware used to modify and customize HTTP requests, and responses used to display views.
