Short Description :
>Maliki Tech Fest is a bootcamp program held by State Islamic University of Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, for students majoring in IT and non-IT. bootcamp programs held at State Islamic University of Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang such as mobile application development using flutter, UI/UX design development using figma, and backend programming with Golang.

I participated in Maliki Tech Fest as a participant in mobile programming with flutter. And the program teaches basic to advanced development using flutter with a combination of displaying the application using figma and the backend using golang.

## Week 1

Installing flutter and dart on each participant's device, learn the basic structure of flutter itself. How to arrange the appearance of the application, starting from paying for the columns and rows that will be used. Familiarize yourself with using stateless and stateful widgets and navigation in Flutter.
